custom replacement board with an nrf52840 module based on the feather board. It features a https://abracon.com/realtimeclock/AB-RTCMC-32.768kHz-IBO5-S3.pdf RTC with a tiny superca for timekeeping. It will take care of generating the extcomin signal and minute-wise updates of the display. In between the updates the MCU can be turned off completely which can lead to very low  overall power consumption of the watch. That way one can just write Sketches for the nrf52840 without having to engineer low power stuff, so one should have a reliable device capable for everyday use. You have native USB for DFU und other communication via the charging cable which has a USB plug connected to the  four contacts anyway. The accelerometer is a BMA400 and the heart rate sensor based on https://pulsesensor.com sitting on a custom flex PCB connected to an analog input: https://github.com/BigCorvus/PulseSensor-for-SMA-Q2/tree/master
